**EDA** *stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It refers to the process of analyzing and summarizing data sets to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights. 
EDA is commonly performed at the beginning of a data analysis project to understand the data and formulate hypotheses.*

The main goals of EDA are as follows:

1.Data Familiarization
: *EDA helps in gaining a basic understanding of the data set, including its size, structure, and variables.*<br>
2.Data Cleaning
: *EDA involves identifying and handling missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data set. It helps in ensuring the data is accurate and reliable for further analysis.*<br>
3.Data Visualization
: *EDA utilizes various graphical techniques to visually represent the data, such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts. Visualizations help in identifying patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.*<br>
4.Descriptive Statistics
: *EDA involves calculating summary statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients. These statistics provide a quantitative description of the data and help in identifying important characteristics.*<br>
5.Hypothesis Generation
: *EDA aids in formulating hypotheses and identifying potential relationships between variables. It helps in guiding further analysis and modeling.*<br>
